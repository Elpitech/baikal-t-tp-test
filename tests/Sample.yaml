# Sample scenario for T-platforms Test framework
---
title: "Sample scenario"
description: |-
    This scenario' purpose is to provide a basic knowledge of the way the
    TP-test scenario files are supposed to look like. Scenario files are
    the YAML-based descriptors of the corresponding test procedures. The
    YAML documents are mappings with three members in the root of the tree
    {title: "", description: "", tests: !!omap {- test1: {arg1: "val1", ...}}}.
    Where 'title' and 'description' members are optional and will be replaced
    with 'undefined' string if not presented. The last member of the mapping
    contains the ordered map of tests being executed during the scenario
    implementation (see the 'tests' element in this file for example). Each
    sub-key of the 'tests' member is supposed to be the key of the corresponding
    test (basically it is the directory name in <root>/cases/<key> with
    'descriptor.yaml' file inside). The arguments names and their order are
    described in the corresponding test descriptor file. Test' key and info
    will be displayed during the scenario execution procedure. Needless to say
    that if 'tests' node isn't specified or empty non of the tests will be
    executed.
tests: !!omap # Must be ordered map (sequence of mappings) or omitted
    - sample_echo: {info: "Echo-command test", arg1: "Hello", arg2: ",", arg3: "echo!"}
    - sample_pass: {info: "Always passed test"}
    - sample_fail: {info: "Always failed test", arg1: "Ignored"}
    - sample_script: {info: "Bash sample script", string: "Hi, tp-test script"}
    - sample_interactive: {info: "Interactive sample test"}
