# Ethernet interfaces loopback test based on the linkloop utility
---
title: "Ethernet linkloop-based test"
description: |-
    Loopbacked ethernet interfaces test is based on the 'linkloop' utility,
    which is able to perform a link-level (level 2) ping procedure. That
    is to send a raw-packet from the source interface determined by 'src_bus'
    'src_addr' to the destination interface MAC-address with specified 'dst_bus'
    and 'dst_addr'. This test is supposed to work either with different
    interfaces connected to each other or with a single source and destination
    interface, which is stubbed with a Tx/Rx loopback cable.
