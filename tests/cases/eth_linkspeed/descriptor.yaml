# Ethernet interfaces link speed test
---
title: "Ethernet link speed test"
description: |-
    Ethernet link speed test is performed by means of 'ethtool' utility and
    is intended to check whether the specified interfaces are able to
    advertise the link Speed/Duplex up to the passed values. Generally
    speaking the speed can be 10, 100 or 1000 (Mb/s), while Duplex - 
    either 'Full' or 'Half', but it isn't prohibited to set any value in
    scenarios making use of this test. Originally this test has been
    created for two interfaces loopbacked to each other, though nothing
    prevents it to be utilized with both interfaces connected to some
    remote device, or with a single loopbacked interface or with a single
    interface connected to some remote device. In the last two cases just
    set both 'iface1' and 'iface2' to be the same device.
