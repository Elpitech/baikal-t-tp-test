# MTD flash write/read test

title: "MTD flash write/read test"
description: |-
    Flash storages are exposed by the Linux kernel as 'mtdX' block devices.
    There is a dedicated toolkit 'mtd-utils', which provides a lot of useful
    utilities to work with them, including a 'nandtest' one, which executes
    an simple erase/write/read/check/resotore cycle in purpose of the interface
    functional testing. So this testcase is a wrapper around the 'nandtest'
    utility to test whether the flash-device behind the 'bus/addr'
    pair is tolerant to the 'nandtest' with set 'passes/checks' at the
    first 'length' bytes of the storage. Note also that the utility accepts
    the 'length' being eraseblocks multiple.
