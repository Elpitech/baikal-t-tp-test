# GPIOs loopback connectivity test
---
title: "GPIOs loopback connectivity test"
description: |-
    The test case is intended to check two GPIOs unidirectional connectivity.
    So first GPIOs 'out_hwid' and 'in_hwid' are requested from
    'out_bus/out_addr' and 'in_bus/in_addr' GPIO adapters. Then as it's obvious
    from the naming the GPIO with 'out_hwid' is set to be output and the GPIO
    with 'in_hwid' - to be input. At final stage a sequence of values
    {!ini,ini} is put to the output GPIO. The test will be considered as
    passed if the same sequence is detected on the input GPIO. In case if the
    lane is marked as 'invereted' then the sequence of inverted values is
    expected on the input side.
