# GPIO output/pulse generator test

title: "GPIO output/pulse generator test"
description: |-
    GPIO output is tested by generating a pulse of the specified 'period' in ms.
    The number of pulses is calculated from the test 'timeout' by the formulae
    ('timeout' - 1) / 'period'. GPIO adapter and ID is determined by the triple
    'bus/addr/hwid'. The test will be considered as passed if the set and got
    GPIO values match. Although the main goal of the testcase is to check PCB
    LEDs by creating a bilking effect. So it should be utilized with a visually
    evaluation performed by a tester.
