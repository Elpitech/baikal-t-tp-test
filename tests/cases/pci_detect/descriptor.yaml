title: "PCI device detection test"
description: |-
    This is simple test, which performs a device detection by given
    'vid' and 'did' (both of them are supposed to be a hex numbers with
    optional '0x' prefix). It tries to find the first available device with
    specified VID/DID pair. Then the script also prints the device info
    to the log file by means of 'lspci' utility and reports that
    the test is passed.
