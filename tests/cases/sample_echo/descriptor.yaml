# Sample echo-command test for T-platforms Test framework
---
title: "Echo-command test"
description: |-
    This test is created as an example of the TP-test framework ability
    to run the executable commands, in particular echo. In this case the
    test 'type' must be 'command' with 'exec' member specifying the
    executable command name available in the environment PATH or being
    a fullpath to the file. The 'args'  mapping element describes the
    command arguments, their order and default values (the actual value
    used for test are specified in the scenario file). 'Interactive'
    boolean flag permits the test to access the program console to
    send/receive data to/from the user and the 'timeout' options specifies
    the test timeout after which the executable is terminated. The last
    two parameters as well as 'title' and 'description' are optional.
    If they aren't not specified the interactive mode will be disabled,
    timeout will be 1000 ms, title and description will be initialized
    with 'undefined' string.
