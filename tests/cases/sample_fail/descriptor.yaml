# Always fail command test for T-platforms Test framework
---
title: "Always failed command test"
description: |-
    This test is created as an example of the TP-test framework ability
    to run the executable commands and detect the error status. In particular
    it executes the 'false' command, which makes this test always finish with
    fialed status. In this case the test 'type' must be 'command' with 'exec'
    member specifying the executable command name available in the environment
    PATH or being a fullpath to the file. The 'args' mapping element describes
    the command arguments, their order and default values (the actual values
    used for the test are specified in the scenario file). 'Interactive'
    boolean flag permits the test to access the program console to send/receive
    data to/from the user and the 'timeout' options specifies the test timeout
    after which the executable is terminated. The last two parameters as
    well as the 'title' and 'description' are optional. If they aren't not
    specified the interactive mode will be disabled, timeout will be 1000 ms,
    title and description will be initialized with 'undefined' string.
