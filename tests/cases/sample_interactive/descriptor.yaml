# Interactive sample test script for T-platforms Test framework
---
title: "Interactive sample test script"
description: |-
    This test is created as an example of the TP-test framework ability
    to run executable files in interactive mode. In this case the test
    'type' must be 'localfile' with 'exec' member specifying the executable
    filename. The 'args' mapping element describes the script arguments
    are absent, while 'interactive' boolean flag is set to 'true' as a sign
    of the test being ineractive, so to enable the corresponding TP-test
    framework functionality. Timeout is extended to 15 seconds, to give a
    time for user interactive actions.
type: "localfile"
exec: "sample_interactive.sh"
interactive: true
timeout: 15000
