# Always passed command test for T-platforms Test framework
---
title: "Always passed command test"
description: |-
    This test is created as an example of the TP-test framework ability
    to run the executable commands and detect the error status. In particular
    it executes the 'true' command, which makes this test always finish with
    passed status. In this case the test 'type' must be 'command' with 'exec'
    member specifying the executable command name available in the environment
    PATH or being a fullpath to the file. The 'args' mapping element is
    supposed to describe the command arguments, their order and default values
    (the actual value used for test can be customized in the scenario file).
    Since this test doesn't accept any argument, the corresponding node is
    omitted. 'Interactive' boolean flag permits the test to access the program
    console to send/receive data to/from the user. The 'timeout' option
    specifies the test timeout after which the executable is terminated.
    The last two parameters as well as 'title' and 'description' are optional.
    If they aren't specified the interactive mode will be disabled, timeout will
    be 1000 ms, title and description will be initialized with 'undefined'
    string.
type: 'command'
exec: 'true'
interactive: false
