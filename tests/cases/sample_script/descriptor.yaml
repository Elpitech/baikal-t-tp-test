# Sample test script for T-platforms Test framework
---
title: "Sample test script"
description: |-
    This test is created as an example of the TP-test framework ability
    to run executable files from the test-specific directory
    '<root>/cases/<testname>/<exec>'. In this case the test 'type'
    must be 'localfile' with 'exec' member specifying the executable
    filename. The 'args' mapping element describes the script arguments,
    their order and default values. 'Interactive' boolean flag permits
    the program to access the program console to send/receive data
    to/from the user and the 'timeout' option specifies the test timeout
    in ms after which the executable is terminated. The last two parameters
    as well as 'title' and 'description' are optional. If they aren't
    specified the interactive mode will be disabled, timeout will be
    1000 ms, title and description will be initialized with 'undefined'
    string.
type: "localfile"
exec: "sample_script.sh"
args: !!omap # Must be ordered map (sequence of mappings) or omitted
    - string: "Sample test string"
