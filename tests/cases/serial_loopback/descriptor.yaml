# Serial ports loopback test
---
title: "Serial ports loopback test"
description: |-
    In order to perform the serial ports loopback test the source interface
    Tx lane (of 'src_bus/src_addr/src_port' device) must be connected with
    destination port Rx lane (of 'dst_bus/dst_addr/dst_port' device).
    The test script customizes the interfaces by enabling the 'raw' mode
    with 'echo' disabled, sets the specified 'baud' rate up and switches
    the 'rs485' mode when it's requested. All of these settings are performed
    by means of the 'stty' utility. Then a pattern is sent over the
    loopbacked line from source to destination port so being expected to come
    unmodified. In this case the test is considered to be passed.
    Depending on the test configuration source and destination ports can be
    either different or the same. Note also that even though some devices
    like 'cp2108' support 'rs485' modes their driver actually can't
    perform the 'rs485' paramter customization. It is supposed to be enabled
    in the device firmware, so in this case the 'rs485' argument should
    be set to 'no'.
