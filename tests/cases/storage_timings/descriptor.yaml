# Storage devices performance test

title: "Storage devices performance test"
description: |-
    This test is intended to perform a complex storage devices interface
    check procedure. Firstly it tests whether the target device really
    exists and detected by the system so the corresponding block device
    is available. Then it executes the performance test by means of
    'hdparm' utility. In order to properly identify the storage device
    the corresponding 'iface' and 'port' must be specified. Finally the
    test is passed only if the retrieved interface performance exceeds
    defined 'cached' and 'buffered' timings (in MB/s).
