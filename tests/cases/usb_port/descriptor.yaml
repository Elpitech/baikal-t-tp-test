title: "USB port test"
description: |-
    USB port existence is tested by means of the sysfs directory nodes.
    In particular if a USB port detects to have a device connected to
    itself the corresponding sysfs node is created in '/sys/bus/usb/device/'
    directory. If such a node pops up within the 'timeout' then the test
    will be considered as passed.
